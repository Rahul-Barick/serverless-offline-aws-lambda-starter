Serverless AWS Lambda Function with node.js

## Q.What is Serverless ?

Answer:- 
1. Serverless services are often called “Functions-as-a-Service” or Faas.
   A serverless “function” is simply code that runs in response to an event. That’s it.
   
2. Build serverless applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run. 
   This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.       
3. The Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. 
   It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture.
